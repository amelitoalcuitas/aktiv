# Aktiv — Sports Hub Scheduler

> **Primary Color:** `#004e89` · **Background:** `#ecf4fc` · **Style:** Flat, minimal, no gradients, use Nuxt UI components as much as possible

---

## Overview

Aktiv is a sports hub discovery and scheduling platform. Users can explore local sports hubs, book courts, join open play sessions, compete in tournaments, and track their rankings — all from one place.

---

## Coding Agent UI Guidelines

Use these rules for all frontend implementation tasks:

- Always use Nuxt UI components first. Build custom components only when Nuxt UI does not cover the use case.
- Do not use hardcoded colors in components, pages, or composables.
- Use Nuxt theme colors/tokens or CSS variables/classes defined in `frontend/app/assets/css/main.css`.
- Keep the visual style flat and minimal. Avoid gradients, glassmorphism, heavy shadows, and overly decorative effects.
- Before creating a new component, check existing files in `frontend/app/components/` (and related feature folders) to reuse or extend what already exists.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Explore Page

Browse and discover sports hubs in your area.

- Search by sport, location, availability, or price
- Filter by court type (tennis, badminton, basketball, etc.)
- **Hub Cards display:**
  - Hub name + cover photo
  - City / neighborhood
  - Courts available (count + types)
  - Lowest price per hour
  - Rating + review count
  - Open now indicator

---

### 2. Hub Profile

Each hub has a dedicated profile page with four main tabs:

#### 📅 Scheduler

The core booking interface.

- Two-panel custom resource grid (no third-party calendar library)
  - **Left:** Mini month calendar — click a day to load that day's availability
  - **Right:** Resource grid — courts as columns, 1-hour time slots as rows (vertically scrollable). Auto-scrolls to current time.
- Time slots are color-coded: Available (green) · Selected (blue) · Pending (amber) · Reserved (red) · Past/Closed (grey)
- **Multi-slot selection:** click any number of available slots across courts and days, then review and confirm in one action
- All scheduler bookings are **private** (exclusive court access). Open Play is a separate flow on the Open Play tab.
- A persistent info notice above the grid advises users to contact the venue to confirm availability, with the hub's contact number(s) displayed inline
- Booking Summary card below the grid shows per-court/day breakdown, sport selection, grand total, and a single **Book Now** button

> 📄 See [SCHEDULER_FLOW.md](SCHEDULER_FLOW.md) for the full booking flow, payment confirmation process, owner walk-in bookings, and schema details.

#### 🏃 Open Play

> **Implementation:** Open Play is a **separate flow from the Scheduler**. The Scheduler only creates private court bookings. Open Play sessions are created via a dedicated "Host a Session" form on this tab and use `session_type = open_play` on the same `bookings` table.

- Lists all upcoming Open Play sessions at this hub
- Each card shows: sport, court, date/time, host, spots filled / total capacity, price per player
- Users can join with one tap (charged per-player, not per-court)
- Host can set max players and a per-player price
- Joined players receive reminders and can see who else joined

#### 🏆 Tournaments

- Hub admins can register a tournament
- Tournament card shows: sport, format (single/double elim, round robin), date range, registration deadline, entry fee, prize info
- Once started, a live **match bracket** is displayed
  - Bracket updates in real time as scores are submitted
  - Players submit scores; hub admins confirm
- Leaderboard within the tournament shows standings (for round robin)

#### 🥇 Leaderboard

- Per-hub leaderboard ranked by:
  - Wins at this hub
  - Tournaments won
  - Hours played
  - Win rate
- Filter by sport type
- Shows player avatar, name, rank badge, key stats
- Global leaderboard tab aggregates stats across all hubs

```

## Timezone Rules

- Store timestamps in UTC and return ISO timestamps from the API.
- Treat each hub's `timezone` as the source of truth for booking-domain logic.
- Use the hub timezone for scheduler math, operating hours, availability, event windows, date filters, and "today" calculations.
- Viewer-local timezone is only for optional convenience display and must never drive availability or conflict logic.
- Do not hardcode `Asia/Manila` in shared frontend or backend logic unless that is the resolved hub timezone value for the record being processed.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Explore (Weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** Users can discover hubs.

- [ ] Project setup: Nuxt 3 + Nuxt UI 4 (frontend), Laravel (backend API), PostgreSQL, Docker Compose
- [ ] Auth: Sign up / login via Laravel Sanctum (email + Google OAuth)
- [ ] Database: `users`, `hubs`, `courts`, `court_sports`, `hub_sports`, `hub_contact_numbers`, `hub_websites`, `app_settings` tables
- [ ] Hub listing: auto-approved on creation (`is_approved = true`), `is_verified = false` by default
- [ ] Explore page: hub cards with search + filters
- [ ] Map view using MapLibre GL JS + OpenFreeMap Bright tiles
- [ ] Hub profile shell (tabs: Scheduler, Open Play, Tournaments, Leaderboard)
- [ ] Hub owner dashboard: create and manage hub, courts, and court sports
- [ ] Design system: `#004e89` primary, `#ecf4fc` background, flat UI components

**Deliverables:** Browsable hub directory, hub detail page with map

---

### Phase 2 — Scheduler & Bookings (Weeks 5–8)

**Goal:** Users can book courts with manual payment confirmation via receipt upload.

- [ ] Scheduler UI: two-panel custom resource grid — mini month calendar (left) + courts × time slots grid (right)
- [ ] Info notice above grid: contact venue to confirm availability (shows hub contact number(s) and website(s))
- [ ] Booking flow: select one or more slots on the grid → review Booking Summary card → Book Now
- [ ] Multi-slot selection: users can pick slots across multiple courts and days in one session
- [ ] All scheduler bookings are `session_type = private`; no session type toggle in the UI
- [ ] Booking requires a logged-in account; guests are shown a Log in to Book button
- [ ] New booking starts as `pending_payment`; slot is immediately blocked on the scheduler
- [ ] User uploads GCash/bank transfer receipt image (digital_bank: within 1 hour or start_time, whichever is sooner; pay_on_site: no receipt needed, booking expires at start_time)
- [ ] Auto-cancel job: cancels `pending_payment` bookings whose `expires_at` has passed
- [ ] On receipt upload, status moves to `pending_review`; hub owner is notified via email
- [ ] Hub owner dashboard: "Pending Confirmations" queue — review receipt, confirm or reject with a note
- [ ] On confirm → status becomes `confirmed`; user is notified
- [ ] On reject → status returns to `pending_payment`; user is notified with rejection reason and can re-upload
- [ ] Owner walk-in bookings: owner can add a booking directly (registered user or anonymous guest) — instantly `confirmed`, no receipt required
- [ ] Conflict detection (no double-booking)
- [ ] Booking management: view, cancel, reschedule
- [ ] Email notifications via Resend (booking created, receipt uploaded, confirmed, rejected, auto-cancelled)
- [ ] ⏳ Online payment gateway: deferred to future phase

**Deliverables:** Full court booking flow with receipt-based manual payment confirmation and owner walk-in support

---

### Phase 3 — Open Play (Weeks 9–11)

**Goal:** Users can create and join public sessions.

- [ ] "Host a Session" form on the Open Play tab: select court, sport, date + time, duration, max players, per-player price → creates a `session_type = open_play` booking
- [ ] Default per-player price (₱150.00) pulled from `app_settings`
- [ ] Open Play tab on hub profile: browse upcoming sessions, spots remaining
- [ ] Open Play slots appear as occupied (non-clickable) on the Scheduler grid for the relevant court + time
- [ ] Join flow (no online payment yet — pay on-site; payment_status tracked in DB)
- [ ] Player list visible to all participants in a session
- [ ] Notifications when session fills up or is cancelled (email via Resend)
- [ ] ⏳ Online payment collection for Open Play: deferred to future phase

**Deliverables:** Discoverable open play sessions, join flow

---

### Phase 4 — Tournaments (Weeks 12–16)

**Goal:** Hubs can run tournaments.

- [ ] Tournament creation by hub admins
- [ ] Team registration (entry fee recorded, collected on-site; ⏳ online payment deferred)
- [ ] Bracket generation (single elim, double elim, round robin)
- [ ] Match scheduling: assign courts & times
- [ ] Score submission by players; **hub admins confirm scores**
- [ ] Live bracket view (polling or server-sent events)
- [ ] Tournament history on hub profile

**Deliverables:** End-to-end tournament management with live brackets

---

### Phase 5 — Leaderboards & Stats (Weeks 17–19)

**Goal:** Player progression and rankings.

- [ ] `player_stats` table with automated updates via match/booking events
- [ ] Per-hub leaderboard (filter by sport)
- [ ] Global leaderboard
- [ ] Player profile: stats, match history, tournaments
- [ ] Rank badges (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.)

**Deliverables:** Functional leaderboards, player profiles

---

### Phase 6 — Polish & Launch (Weeks 20–22)

**Goal:** Production-ready website launch.

- [ ] Reviews & ratings for hubs
- [ ] Hub admin: mark hubs with Verified tag (is_verified flag)
- [ ] Hub analytics dashboard (bookings, court utilization, popular times)
- [ ] Performance optimization (caching, lazy load, image optimization)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] SEO (hub pages, explore page)
- [ ] Beta testing + feedback loop
- [ ] **Provision Hetzner VPS** — set up server, Docker Compose, SSL (Let's Encrypt), domain, env vars
- [ ] Deploy to Hetzner and smoke test before public launch

---

### Future Phases (Post-Launch)

- [ ] **Payment integration** — online booking payments + Open Play per-player collection
- [ ] **Admin panel** — manage `app_settings` (e.g. Open Play price), approve/verify hubs
- [ ] **PWA / Mobile app** — progressive web app first, then evaluate native
- [ ] **SMS notifications** — via free/low-cost gateway

---

## Timezone Rules

All timestamps are stored as **UTC** in PostgreSQL `timestamp without timezone` columns (Laravel default). The app's local timezone is **Asia/Manila (UTC+8)**.

### Backend — date-range queries

When filtering by a YYYY-MM-DD calendar date received from the frontend, always convert through the Manila timezone AND call `.utc()` before passing to Eloquent:

```php
// CORRECT
Carbon::parse($request->date_from, 'Asia/Manila')->startOfDay()->utc()
Carbon::parse($request->date_to,   'Asia/Manila')->endOfDay()->utc()
now('Asia/Manila')->startOfDay()->utc()

// WRONG — naive string passed to PostgreSQL, compared against UTC-stored values
Carbon::parse($request->date_from, 'Asia/Manila')->startOfDay()
now()->startOfDay()
```

Bare `now()` (UTC) is correct for `expires_at` storage and expiry checks — both sides of the comparison are already UTC.

### Frontend → API date params

Send `YYYY-MM-DD` strings built with local JS date methods (`.getFullYear()` etc.). This is correct — it represents the Manila calendar date the user is viewing. The backend's `Asia/Manila` Carbon parse interprets it correctly.

### Frontend — displaying API timestamps

API responses contain ISO strings with a UTC offset (e.g. `2026-03-20T22:00:00+00:00`). Always include `timeZone: 'Asia/Manila'` when passing to `toLocaleString` / `toLocaleDateString` / `toLocaleTimeString`:

```ts
// CORRECT
new Date(iso).toLocaleString('en-PH', { timeZone: 'Asia/Manila', ... })

// WRONG — depends on browser's system timezone
new Date(iso).toLocaleString('en-PH', { ... })
```

### Frontend — booking time construction

`setHours(h, m, 0, 0)` followed by `.toISOString()` is correct — it sets the local Manila hour and converts to UTC ISO for the API.

```js
// nuxt.config.ts — install maplibre-gl via npm
// npm install maplibre-gl

const map = new maplibregl.Map({
  container: 'map',
  style: 'https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/bright',
  center: [125.6, 7.07], // default: Davao City
  zoom: 12
});
```

---

## Production Deployment Notes

### Laravel Scheduler (Required)

The app uses Laravel's task scheduler for background jobs (e.g. auto-cancelling expired bookings). In production, add a single cron entry on the server:

```
* * * * * cd /var/www && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This one entry covers all scheduled commands — no additional setup needed when new scheduled tasks are added.

> In local Docker dev, a dedicated `scheduler` service in `docker-compose.yml` runs `php artisan schedule:work` instead.

| Mailpit UI      | `http://localhost:8025`                                          |
| PostgreSQL      | `localhost:5433` (direct, for DB clients like TablePlus/DBeaver) |
| Redis           | `localhost:6379` (direct, for debugging)                         |

> **Note:** PostgreSQL is on host port `5433` (not `5432`) to avoid conflict with other projects running on the default port.

> **WSL note:** Use `localhost` from your Windows browser — WSL 2 automatically forwards ports to Windows. If ports don't resolve, run `wsl hostname -I` to get the WSL IP as a fallback.

### WSL-Specific Tips

- Store the project inside the WSL filesystem (`~/projects/aktiv`) **not** on the Windows mount (`/mnt/c/...`). File I/O on Windows mounts is significantly slower.
- Docker Desktop for Windows with the WSL 2 backend is the recommended setup. Alternatively, install Docker Engine directly inside WSL.
- `vendor/` and `node_modules/` live on your local WSL filesystem and are mounted into the containers. This means VS Code IntelliSense and autocomplete work natively — run `composer install` and `npm install` in WSL once to set them up locally.
- Mailpit replaces Resend in local dev — all outgoing emails are caught at `http://localhost:8025`. No emails actually send during local development.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start all containers
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f frontend
docker compose logs -f backend

# Laravel artisan
docker compose exec backend php artisan migrate
docker compose exec backend php artisan make:controller ExampleController

# Nuxt / npm (adding packages)
docker compose exec frontend npm install maplibre-gl
```

### Key Notes

**`utils/api.ts`** — configure `$fetch` here with your Laravel base URL and attach the Sanctum token on every request automatically. This keeps API calls clean and consistent across all composables.

**`plugins/maplibre.client.ts`** — the `.client` suffix tells Nuxt to only load MapLibre in the browser, never during SSR. Required because MapLibre depends on `window` and `document`.

**`composables/` vs `stores/`** — composables handle API calls and business logic; Pinia stores hold shared reactive state. For example, `useBooking.ts` makes the API call, but `stores/booking.ts` holds the currently selected time slot so the calendar and booking modal stay in sync without prop drilling.

**`components/ui/`** — put any custom wrapper components around Nuxt UI here (e.g. a `BaseBadge` that always uses your brand color). Keeps Nuxt UI overrides in one place.

## Decisions & Notes

| Topic                         | Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Multi-sport courts            | ✅ A court supports multiple sports via `court_sports` table; user picks sport at booking time                                                                                                                     |
| Open Play pricing             | ✅ Per-player at ₱150.00 default; stored in `app_settings` for admin panel changes                                                                                                                                 |
| Tournament score confirmation | ✅ Hub admins confirm submitted scores                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Mobile app                    | ⏳ Website only for now; PWA/native planned post-launch                                                                                                                                                            |
| Hub listing approval          | ✅ Auto-approved (`is_approved = true`) for now; `is_verified` flag reserved for future Verified badge                                                                                                             |
| Booking payment               | ✅ Receipt upload flow — user pays offline (GCash/bank transfer), uploads receipt, owner confirms manually. Statuses: `pending_payment` → `payment_sent` → `confirmed`. See [SCHEDULER_FLOW.md](SCHEDULER_FLOW.md) |
| Online payment gateway        | ⏳ Deferred to future phase; all price fields stored in DB now to ease future integration                                                                                                                          |
| Booking auth requirement      | ✅ Account required to book; guests redirected to login/register                                                                                                                                                   |
| Slot holding / auto-cancel    | ✅ `expires_at` is payment-method-aware: `digital_bank` → `min(now + 1h, start_time)`; `pay_on_site` → `start_time`. `CancelExpiredBookings` command cancels when `expires_at` passes.                             |
| Owner walk-in bookings        | ✅ Owners can add bookings for on-site customers (registered user or anonymous guest); instantly confirmed                                                                                                         |
| Scheduler contact notice      | ✅ Non-dismissible info alert above calendar; shows hub contact numbers from `hub_contact_numbers`                                                                                                                 |
| Hub rating formula            | ✅ Bayesian average (`C=5, prior=3.5`): `(5×3.5 + avg×count) / (5+count)`. Used everywhere a hub rating is displayed (explore cards, hub detail, profile owned-hubs card). Raw average is never shown.             |
| Maps                          | ✅ OpenFreeMap (Bright tiles) + MapLibre GL JS — fully free, no API key needed                                                                                                                                     |
| Frontend framework            | ✅ Nuxt 3 + Nuxt UI 4 + Pinia (uses npm)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hosting                       | Local dev on WSL Ubuntu + Docker Compose; Hetzner VPS provisioned before Phase 6 launch                                                                                                                            |
